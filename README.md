## Vecos Spaces Template
Welcome to the official repository for Vecos Metaverse Spaces Creator.

Vecos is a metaverse creator application available on our [website](https://hyper.vecos.us). This repository hosts a Unity template designed to enable you to create Vecos spaces (metaverses) within the Vecos metaverse itself.

At present, this project is using Unity version 2022.3.16f1.

----------------------------------------
## Quick Start
- You will have to clone this repository.
```git
git clone https://github.com/TheMaysTRol/VecosSpacesTemplate.git
```
- Open the project using unity hub.
- Start creating your own scene (follow for more specifications)

## Setup the scene
- Let's start by creating a new scene in the Scenes folder,You can name the scene as you like(in my case I choose the name Demo).

 Lets add the created scene to the unity addressables system :
  Go to Window -> Asset Management -> Addressables -> Groups
In the groups window you will find an exisiting default group called "AddressablesGroup"

 Grab the scene you've just created and drop it inside that group

 Right click on the scene in the addressables groups window and choose "Simplify Addressables Names"

## Create the scene that you want

- You can now add objects to your scene(3d models,ui ...)

- For me I will just create the ground
